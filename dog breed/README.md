# Project Overview

The project is about classifying a dog-image according to its breed. 
The algorithm which I am about to describe can be used as a part of a mobile app or web app.
The algorithm will accept an image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dogâ€™s breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

# Project Instructions

1. Clone the repository in your project folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
	cd deep-learning-v2-pytorch/project-dog-classification
  ```

2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).

3. Download the [human dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz).

4. Install all necessary python packages.

5. Open a new terminal and start a jupyter notebook by typing the code below

```
jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
```

### NOTE: You can also use GPU for training purpose.
