# Project Overview

The project is about classifying a dog-image according to its breed. 
The algorithm which I am about to describe can be used as a part of a mobile app or web app.
The algorithm will accept an image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dogâ€™s breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
